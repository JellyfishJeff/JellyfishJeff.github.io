                <h3> My Goal</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                SInce I was a little boy, I loved legos. The love and excitement I felt while stacking up these objects to build something
                just explain my goal to become a mechanical engineer. Always, I used to watch National Geographic channel or
                Discovery science every tuesdays and thursdays because there was a special show about the manufacturing of cars.
                This made me want to be a mechanical engineer at Ferrari or some car manufacturing company but with time, I thought
                more of fields like aeronautics or even aerospace. I wish to work for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
                unless my interest changes, which I doubt will. It is not just a dream for I know I can do it. I plan to study at PURDUE University for a lot of role models and speakers recommend it as a good college.

            <h3>Track and Field</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>So, I practice track and field. The first I tried that sports was in the year 2018. In the beginning, it was
                hard with the cold weather which had no end. Other days practice will even be harder but YOU CAN'T GIVE UP
                WHEN IT GETS HARD. So I continued coming to practice and later, I really enjoyed running. According to team
                mates, I was pretty fast but I wasn't where I wanted to be yet. I am a sprinter. Basically I chose races
                like the 100m and 200m dashes because I don't like long races. Yes, I can say it out loud I'm LAZY! For my
                first season, I did pretty good and I am so determined and looking to the 2019 season already.</p>

            <h3>Drawing</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>A passion. A strong and barely controllable emotion for this artwork. Drawing is a thing my elder brother liked
                doing and me, copying my brother is a thing I like doing. I've been drawing a lot and my work was always
                appreciated by my fellow friends and mates. Through out the years, I've been drawing but the feeling and
                love for it were gradually diminishing. In tenth grade I decided to stop drawing. Not because I couldn't
                draw anymore but just because I didn't feel that passion anymore. After six months, I realised I couldn't
                do this anymore so took back my pencil and paper and I was pretty proud of the drawing of Joel Osteen I made
                that night. That's how I started drawing and I really made a lot of progress since and I won't stop. Go to
                my Instagram page to see some of my drawings
