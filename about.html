        <h1>MY PROJECTS</h1>
        <h2>Nextech</h2>
        Nextech is an internship which focuses on coding using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is through this program that I learned
        the basics of html and css and was able to produce this portfolio. It was an awesome experience for me as I got to
        visit a lot of tech comapnies and universities which include; Kronos, Studio science, IUPUI, Eli Lilly, Salesforce
        database center, Butler university, and others.
