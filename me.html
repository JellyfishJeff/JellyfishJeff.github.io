    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <h3>Track and Field</h3>
    <p>So, I practice track and field. The first I tried that sports was in the year 2018. In the beginning, it was hard with
        the cold weather which had no end. Other days practice will even be harder but YOU CAN'T GIVE UP WHEN IT GETS HARD.
        So I continued coming to practice and later, I really enjoyed running. According to team mates, I was pretty fast
        but I wasn't where I wanted to be yet. I am a sprinter. Basically I chose races like the 100m and 200m dashes because
        I don't like long races. Yes, I can say it out loud I'm LAZY! For my first season, I did pretty good and I am so
        determined and looking to the 2019 season already.</p>
    <h3>Soccer</h3>
    <p>Soccer, known as football in all the other parts of the world is a really fun sports. It's a source of pleisure for a
        lot of kids. I practice soccer at my high school too. It is a fun sports and even though I know I'm not as good as
        other players, I do what I can when I can. Every person can contribute to the team as whole.To me, the most important
        part is to have fun and make friends. So if you are reading this right now, I just suggest you try a sports you like.
        It's good for your health too. </p>
    <h3>Drawing</h3>
    <p>A passion. A strong and barely controllable emotion for this artwork. Drawing is a thing my elder brother liked doing and me, copying my brother is a thing I like doing. I've been drawing a lot and my work was always appreciated by my fellow friends and mates. Through out the years, I've been drawing but the feeling and love for it were gradually diminishing. In tenth grade I decided to stop drawing. Not because I couldn't draw anymore but just because I didn't feel that passion anymore. After six months, I realised I couldn't do this anymore so took back my pencil and paper and I was pretty proud of the drawing of Joel Osteen I made that night. That's how I started drawing and I really made a lot of progress since and I won't stop. Go to my Instagram page to see some of my drawings <a href="http://Instagram">My_names_jeff2k18</a> </p>
